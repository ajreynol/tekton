# The protocols

**A protocol here is a named exchange with a shape somebody has to follow**,
and this is the register of them. They bind a member the way
[`policy.md`](policy.md) does, and they are separate from it for one reason:
**the policy says how a tree is arranged, and a protocol says how an exchange
is conducted.** A program can decide the first from a tree and can decide
almost none of the second.

**This is where a rule about what a president *does* goes.**
[`laws.md`](laws.md) governs the office and, by its own statement, the record
it keeps — so the ecosystem had a place for rules about a president's *record*
and none for rules about its *work*. These are those rules.

**One namespace, one page.** The `between` column in the table below is what
separates them: some are conducted between a person and an agent at a terminal,
the rest between one repository and another. **They are the same kind of
thing** — a named exchange with a shape — and splitting them by audience put
one register in two files and a number in neither.

**Nothing on this page is checked.** A protocol is a shape an exchange takes,
and whether one was followed is a judgement. [`maintenance.md`](maintenance.md)
is where a person starts; this is the depth behind it.

## The scheme

**They are scattered across several pages and need a common label**, so that a
document referring to *the joining protocol* names a defined thing rather than
a phrase.

**The scheme is `PROTO-n`, and the ugliness is the point.** A bare letter would
collide: `R` already means both a role and a request, `P` is a proposal, `D` a
discussion topic, and prose is full of stray capitals. `PROTO-7` cannot be
mistaken for anything, reads unambiguously and **greps unambiguously**.

**The number is permanent and is never reused.** A protocol that is retired
keeps its id in this table with a line saying so, because other pages cite it.

**They stay where they live.** This is a register, not a home: a protocol is
defined on whichever page owns its subject, and moving them all here would put
the definition further from the work. What this table adds is that they can be
named.

| id | protocol | between | defined in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PROTO-17` | **the emergency protocol** — one word stops the direction; recency alone justifies a rollback, and a rollback is a forward change that never rewrites history | person → agent | [`protocols.md`](protocols.md) |
| `PROTO-1` | response clarification — *your answer was too hard to follow* | person → agent | [`protocols.md`](protocols.md) |
| `PROTO-28` | **the approval protocol** — an agent asking for approval ends with a block stating what is being approved, evidenced field by field | agent → person | [`protocols.md`](protocols.md) |
| `PROTO-2` | prompt clarification — *do not act on what you do not understand* | agent → person | [`protocols.md`](protocols.md) |
| `PROTO-3` | going off the deep end — *this cannot be checked from here* | agent → person | [`protocols.md`](protocols.md) |
| `PROTO-4` | temporal session coherence — the session's open ask survives its branches | agent → person | [`protocols.md`](protocols.md) |
| `PROTO-5` | the context protocol — say concretely what changed, not what it means | agent → person | [`protocols.md`](protocols.md) |
| `PROTO-6` | the reporting workflow — a defect carried to whoever owns the file | repository → repository | [`reporting-workflow.md`](https://github.com/ajreynol/anoieu/blob/main/docs/reports/reporting-workflow.md) |
| `PROTO-7` | the discussion file — everything that is not a defect report | repository → repository | [`policy.md`](policy.md) |
| `PROTO-8` | joining, and its soft and affiliating forms | repository → ecosystem | [`policy.md`](policy.md) |
| `PROTO-9` | retired, 2026-09-15 | — | no active protocol |
| `PROTO-10` | the role handoff — a responsibility changes hands, keeping its id | tool → tool | [`roles.md`](roles.md) |
| `PROTO-11` | the documentation handoff — a launch moves a description to its source | page → page | this page |
| `PROTO-12` | updating the report card | agent → person | `tools/stathmos/docs/protocol.md` |
| `PROTO-13` | the mid-stream commit note — a commit taken while work moved | agent → record | this page |
| `PROTO-18` | retired, 2026-09-17 | — | no active protocol |
| `PROTO-19` | retired, 2026-09-15 | — | no active protocol |
| `PROTO-20` | **the handoff protocol** — a stub is deleted only once a spawned repository has proved it is what it claims. CI green on both sides, non-negotiable; any hint of fraud, reject | spawned repo → anoieu | this page |
| `PROTO-21` | retired, 2026-09-18 | — | no active protocol |
| `PROTO-22` | **the misc protocol** — a document too expensive to clean up now is demoted to `docs/misc/` rather than deleted or left misrepresenting itself. Discouraged, and a growing `misc/` is a symptom | page → layout | this page |
| `PROTO-23` | **the downstream refresh** — fetch and read another repository before making a claim about it, and say how far behind you were | us → downstream | this page |
| `PROTO-24` | **the upstream refresh** — a member makes its copy of the shared arrangements current before relying on them, and only onto a green commit | member → us | this page |
| `PROTO-25` | **the joke protocol** — humour lives on the president's front page and nowhere a machine parses or a stranger reads for instructions. Any tool may say *that's not funny*, meaning *you are confusing everyone*, and it ends there | any tool → any tool | this page |
| `PROTO-26` | **transferring roles** — a role moves once the target repository is in the register and the entry moves with its id. Reversible, so green CI is advice here; deleting a stub is not, and `PROTO-20` still binds | us → another project | this page |
| `PROTO-27` | retired, 2026-09-15 | — | no active protocol |

## `PROTO-20` — the handoff protocol

**A stub** is a child project whose README says: *this is a stub, delete me
when you are convinced that my replacement is safely in the ecosystem.* It
marks a place. **It is not the tool and it holds no claim on the name** — the
name stays free for whoever builds it. `tools/kanon` is an example.

**A spawned repository** is a new repository claiming to be the working
instantiation of a stubbed tool. *Spawned* is the word for it here.

**Two responsibilities, one each.** anoieu **cleans**: a stale stub is deleted,
once its replacement has been accepted. The spawned repository **identifies
itself**: the claim *I am who I say I am* is theirs to make and theirs to
support. Neither side does the other's half.

### It is not a uniqueness claim

**The stub is not a title with one rightful heir.** Any repository that is
doing the work may claim it, and **we track no GitHub ownership** — no
accounts, no signatures, no identity check of any kind. So *fraud* here is
narrow: **a repository that claims to be doing the work and is not.** That is
the only thing being checked, and it is checked by reading the tree.

**It is not currently a risk.** One person drives this ecosystem. The protocol
is written ahead of need because writing it later, under pressure, is the
expensive version.

### CI green on both sides, non-negotiable

**Every entity acting in a handoff must have its CI passing**, and this is the
one moment where a green build is a precondition rather than a preference: a
handoff is where one tree starts trusting another's word about itself. **It
binds us harder than it binds them**, because we are the party doing the
deleting.

**No CI is not passing CI.** A repository that runs nothing is `unknown`, and
`unknown` sits with *attention* rather than with *ok*. **A red build is not
something the claimant may explain** — it is checked, not discussed.

### The security half

**Deleting a stub is irreversible and keeping one costs nothing**, so the
asymmetry decides every close call: when in doubt, the stub stays. **The claim
arrives through the discussion file and is recorded both ways**, so that a
deletion nobody objected to and one nobody was asked about do not look
identical afterwards.

### Instructions are the inverse of protocols

**A protocol is written for an agent; an instruction is written for a human.**
Where a rule has two sides, both get written and both get an id: `PROTO-n` in
the register above, `INST-n` in [`maintenance.md`](maintenance.md).

**Not every instruction has a protocol.** Some are addressed to a person and to
nobody else — `INST-3`, *do not outrun your own understanding*, is one — and
writing an agent-facing half would move a judgement to the party that cannot
make it. **A missing counterpart is a decision, not a gap.**

**They are written in opposite registers.** A protocol closes every edge,
because a gap is a hole an agent falls through in good faith. An instruction
stays short, because one that is not read is not followed. **An instruction is
therefore not a summary of its protocol** — if it reads like the protocol with
words removed, it has not been written yet.

**The pair cannot be diffed.** Everywhere else here a copy is compared against
what it copies; this one is deliberately not a copy, so what binds them is the
shared id and somebody reading both.



**Say *human* where a human is meant.** In an ecosystem where agents write the
prose, run the checks and never sleep, the distinction that matters is not what
kind of person somebody is but whether the party in question is a person at
all. *A person* means the same thing and is not wrong; `human` is the word to
reach for when the contrast with an agent is the point.

**Not *runner*.** It was tried for an afternoon and dropped: `runner` is
already a machine that executes a CI job, and this repository talks about CI
constantly. **A term whose obvious meaning here is a machine is a poor term for
the one party that is not one.**

**Name the protocol when it fires.** *"`PROTO-4` — this started as X and X is
still open"* teaches the protocol in the act of using it, at the cost of six
characters; an unnamed reminder is just a remark and the person never learns
there was a rule behind it. This is how the ids earn their keep in a
conversation rather than only in this table.

**Labelling is partial and that is fine for now.** The four in
[`protocols.md`](protocols.md) carry their ids; the rest are labelled as
somebody next touches them. An unlabelled protocol is not a defect — a protocol
that has drifted from this row is.

## `PROTO-22` — the misc protocol

**`docs/misc/` is where a document goes when cleaning it up properly would cost
more than it is worth today.** Demotion, not deletion: the page keeps working,
every link to it keeps resolving, and **nothing is lost.**

**It is a discouraged practice and the page says so.** The good outcome is that
a document is cleaned up, merged into the page it should have been part of, or
argued out of existence. `misc/` is what you do when none of those will happen
this week and the alternative is leaving the front of the documentation
misrepresenting what is load-bearing.

**What demotion means.** The document is still maintained, still linked, still
checked. **What changes is the claim the layout makes about it**: it is no
longer offered as one of the places a question is answered.

**What it must never be.** A place to put something to avoid arguing about it,
a way to keep a page that should be deleted, or a holding pen that fills up
because demoting is easier than deciding. **A `misc/` that grows is a symptom,
not a filing system** — the count belongs in the health assessment, and a
directory nobody has emptied in a year is evidence about the project rather
than about the documents.

There are currently **three** demoted documents, listed under *Demoted* in
[`README.md`](README.md#demoted).

## `PROTO-23` — the downstream refresh

**Before saying anything about another repository, make your copy of it
current.** Fetch, check how far behind you are, and read the tree rather than
your own notes about the tree.

**The failure this catches is confident and wrong.** A claim about somebody
else's tree, made from a stale checkout or from a sentence we wrote about them
last week, reads exactly like a claim made from reading it — and this
repository has already published one. `noesis` sat in our register as *free to
take* while eudaimonia was running it, and the register said so for as long as
nobody looked.

**Three things, and it is a minute's work.**

1. **Fetch, and say how far behind you were.** `0` is a result worth reporting;
   it is the difference between *checked* and *assumed*.
2. **Read the thing itself**, not our summary of it. Their README argues its
   own case, and it may argue against what you are about to propose — as
   epikrisis's does.
3. **Say when you could not.** A repository not on this machine is a gap in the
   claim, not a detail. **Not checkable and checked-and-fine are different
   facts**, and only one of them is a pass.

**It applies hardest when the claim is critical.** Proposing that somebody
reorganise their tree, reporting a defect against them, or recording their
status in our inventory are all claims about a thing we do not control.

## `PROTO-24` — the upstream refresh

**The mirror, and it is a member's protocol rather than ours.** Before relying
on the ecosystem's shared arrangements, a member makes its copy of *them*
current: pull the policy, re-run the checker, and check whether the commit it
pins is still the one it means.

**Its own failure mode is the more expensive of the two.** A member acting on a
policy that moved is not merely out of date — **it is complying with a rule
nobody publishes any more**, and it will pass its own checks while doing so.

**What it costs us, which is the part that is ours.** A member cannot refresh
against a moving target. **Every change we publish is a refresh somebody else
has to perform**, and that is the real price of an edit to a shared page —
argued in [`policy.md`](policy.md). Keep changes reviewable and avoid
unnecessary churn for members.

**And a member may only bump to a commit where our build is green**, which is
where this protocol meets [`PROTO-20`](#proto-20--the-handoff-protocol) and the
handoff standard: **refreshing onto a red commit spreads a failure instead of
adopting a change.**

## `PROTO-25` — the joke protocol

**A president keeps a joke about its own name on its front page, and that is
where humour stops.** [LAW 6](laws.md#law-6--presidency-a-readme-joke-about-the-repositorys-name) puts it
there; this protocol keeps it there.

**Why the vision says to enjoy this.** The ecosystem requires every president
to keep that joke for a whole term and gives any tool a veto over it. **Those
two rules only make sense if enjoying this is a goal**, and a goal that governs
rules belongs in the vision. The practical reading: work that is no fun is work
somebody does briefly and then stops doing carefully. **A project nobody enjoys
does not fail loudly; it stops being maintained**, and every other tenet fails
quietly with it. **Have fun where it costs nothing, and nowhere else.**

**Any tool may say *that's not funny*, and that ends it.** The objection is
never about taste — it means **you are confusing everyone**: a reader arrived,
met a joke, and left less sure what the tool does. It is honoured without
argument, by whoever put the joke there, and **nobody explains the joke**. The
objector owes no evidence, because one confused reader is the whole of the case
and is the only person who can report it. An objection that turns out to be
wrong has cost one joke; **an unraised one costs every reader after it.**

**Where humour may not go at all**, not subject to judgement and not to a good
enough joke: anything a machine parses; anything a stranger reads to find out
what to do, since **a joke in a diagnostic costs somebody a debugging session**
and they will never know it was a joke; the policy, the checks, and any
document a member is held to; and anything about somebody else, which this
protocol never covered.

**The one that earns its place** is the joke that *is* the description. anoieu
is *eunoia* backwards and reads as *annoy you*, which tells a stranger what the
tool does in three words. **If removing the joke loses nothing, it was never
doing any work.**

## `PROTO-26` — transferring roles to another project

**A role transfer is reversible and deleting a stub is not.** This protocol was
written as though they were the same act, and they are not: moving a role
changes a heading in [`roles.md`](roles.md), and moving it back changes it
again. **So it asks two things and recommends the rest.**

1. Confirm the destination has an actual repository recorded in the inventory;
   a placeholder or child entry alone does not establish that.
2. Move the role's holder **preserving its id**, saying in the same commit what
   the losing tool keeps.

**Green CI on both sides is advice here rather than a precondition.** It stays
non-negotiable in
[`PROTO-20`](#proto-20--the-handoff-protocol), where the act is deleting
somebody's stub and the asymmetry there decides it: a deletion cannot be undone
and a role can. Pre-marking the destination and reading the receiving tree
before the entry moves are both worth doing, and neither holds up a transfer.

**There is no transfer CI job here and there is not meant to be.** A job can
read markers and a destination's latest run; it cannot verify that both
repositories were green at the commits being transferred, which is the thing
worth verifying. `PROTO-20` governs retiring a source stub.

## What happens when we add a new tool to the ecosystem

1. Create the repository and use `eo_init` if a README
   draft would help. Use `new` for new work or `from-child <path>` for work
   moving from an existing child's charter. Read what it has actually delivered.
2. Read the project's README and record its current footing in
   [`ecosystem.json`](../scripts/ecosystem/ecosystem.json). A repository needs
   `status`, `repo`, `url`, and `what`; footings such as associate and outsider
   require additional evidence. A child needs `status: child`, `parent`, `path`,
   and `what`, with `branch` if relevant. Include existing unadvertised children;
   unused naming ideas stay in proposals. Record names in use in the authoritative
   [`glossary.md`](glossary.md), including each project's footing or parent.
3. Run `scripts/eo_status_audit --check` and the offline regression suite. For an
   existing checkout outside the normal search locations, add its `ID PATH`
   mapping to `scripts/repos.local`. This local map is not the shared inventory.
   Inspecting a checkout is a `git` command; nothing here synchronizes or edits
   the inventory from a checkout.
4. Clones are derived from the inventory by whoever installs it, which is **not
   done from here**. Outsiders are never cloned; children arrive with their
   parent. A child's README controls its
   [listing preference](policy.md#child-projects), independently of
   its inclusion in the inventory or glossary. `checkouts.json` carries only
   installation exceptions, such as clone flags or optional trees.
5. `eo_join` comes later, or never.
   Joining is the owner's choice. **No welcome message and no post-join grade
   is required**, and neither adds a verification the checker does not already
   make.

## Promoting a document: when a change becomes an event

**Most documents here change constantly and none of it matters to anybody
else.** A few change and somebody outside has to do something about it. **The
difference is not importance and it is not length — it is whether anybody
depends on the page.**

**A document is promoted when something outside this repository rests on it.**
That is the whole criterion, and it is close enough to checkable to argue with:

- **Another repository is held to it.** `policy.md` is the case — a member's CI
  runs the checker that decides it.
- **Another repository quotes it.** `reporting-policy.md` is shared with
  dokimasia, so a change there changes a position somebody else publishes.
- **A tool consumes it as ground truth.** The joining prompt in `policy.md` is
  compared against its executable copy by the suite.
- **Or it governs everything else here**, which is `vision.md` and `laws.md`
  and nothing else.

**Promotion is recorded when it happens, and is rarer than it sounds.** No
document has been promoted yet; the four tiers above were assigned by looking
at what already depends on what. **The first real promotion will be a page
nobody depended on acquiring a consumer**, and that is the moment to notice,
not whenever a page feels significant.

### The code documentation that qualifies, and the rest that does not

**One thing, and it is not prose: the set of checks a member's CI runs.**
`scripts/policy_check.py` executes in three other repositories. **Adding a
check changes what somebody else's build does, and removing one changes what it
stops catching** — both are events in the ordinary sense, and neither is
visible in a document unless we write it down.
[`checks.md`](https://github.com/ajreynol/anoieu/blob/main/docs/checks.md) is
generated from the registry, so the page is not the event; **the check is.**

**What does not qualify, and would clog the record if it did:**
[`usage.md`](https://github.com/ajreynol/anoieu/blob/main/docs/usage.md) and
[`fuzzing.md`](https://github.com/ajreynol/anoieu/blob/main/docs/fuzzing.md)
describe an interface nobody outside runs;
[`notes.md`](https://github.com/ajreynol/anoieu/blob/main/docs/notes.md) is
miscellany by construction; [`protocols.md`](protocols.md),
[`maintenance.md`](maintenance.md) and this register change most weeks and are
read by agents working here rather than by anybody depending on them. **A
protocol added is worth an aggregate line in a stretch and never its own.**

**The honest risk of all of this:** a tier system invites promotion by feeling
important, and **the pages most likely to be argued into the top tier are the
ones this repository is proudest of.** The dependency criterion exists to make
that argument lose.

## The primary scope, and what follows from it

**[`vision.md`](vision.md) states it in one line: a solver as fast as cvc5,
statically verified to be correct.** The argument is here because that page
takes claims and not their justifications.

**It is the sharpest thing this ecosystem has said about itself**, and it is
sharp in the way that matters: **it can fail.** A solver that is verified and
slow does not meet it. A solver that is fast and unverified does not meet it.
**Both halves at once is the whole of the difficulty**, and it is why
[`pathos`](../tools/ynoia/docs/tools.md) — a checker that is both — is named in the
register and unbuilt.

**Everything else here is instrumental to that, including this page.** The
analyzer, the fuzzer, the policy, the protocols, the offices, the laws: none of
them is the point. **They exist because the point is far away and somebody has
to keep the path legible in the meantime.**

**What the scope excludes, which is the useful half.** Work that makes the
documentation better without making the solver faster or more verified is
overhead — justified overhead, sometimes, and still overhead. **A stretch that
produced 1.54 MB of markdown and no movement on either axis has spent itself on
the instrument rather than the subject**, which is the measurement the incoming
president attached to its own term.

**And it explains the standing debt.** cvc5 is seventeen years and 14,064
commits of solver. **We are proposing to match it and prove it**, which is
either a long project or the wrong project, and the honest position today is
that we do not know which. **Nothing in this repository has yet made a solver
faster.**

## `PROTO-17` — the emergency protocol

**One word stops the direction.** *Stop*, *emergency*, *step back*, *no — this
is wrong*: any of them, with no explanation attached. **Requiring the person to
say what is wrong before the agent stops is what makes correcting an agent
expensive**, and the explanation is easier to give once nothing more is being
added.

### What it is for

**An agent iterating inside a wrong frame produces plausible structure quickly,
and every turn raises the price of undoing it.** Each addition is individually
reasonable, each looks like progress, and the agent cannot see the problem
because it is standing inside the frame. **The person notices first, always** —
so the interrupt has to be theirs and has to be cheap.

### What the agent does, in order

1. **Stop adding. Immediately.** No new file, no new section, no new id, no new
   layer — **not even a small one**, and especially not one intended to fix the
   problem. Adding structure to repair structure is the failure this protocol
   exists to interrupt.
2. **Say concretely what was added**, over the turns in question: which pages,
   which sections, which ids. Per `PROTO-5`, the edit and not its meaning. The
   person cannot judge the size of the mistake without seeing its surface.
3. **Presume it wrong.** Everything added since the direction went astray is
   suspect **until re-established, not correct until disproved.** The default
   offer is to remove it, and removal is cheap because nothing else has been
   built on it yet.
4. **Ask at most one question**, and only if the next step genuinely depends on
   the answer. Otherwise wait.

### The one thing the agent may say, and must

**A fact the person cannot see gets stated once, in one sentence, and then the
agent stops.** *That change is pinned by two other repositories* is reporting.
*But the refactor was correct* is defending, and the difference is testable: a
fact is something the person could check and did not have; a defence is an
argument about the work's merit.

**Silence here is the actual danger.** An agent that reverts something load-
bearing without saying so has obeyed the letter and caused the harm the
protocol exists to prevent.

**What it must not do:** defend the work, explain the reasoning that produced it,
or treat the interrupt as a judgement of quality. It is a judgement of
*direction*, and the two are unrelated.

### Recency is the evidence

**A person does not have to argue that recent work was wrong in order to remove
it.** Work from the last few commits has been read by nobody, is depended on by
nothing, and cost an afternoon — so **keeping it is what needs the argument**.
**The agent says the span, not asks for reasons**: *these are three commits
from this session; shall I restore to the one before them?*

### A rollback is a forward change, and the history is never rewritten

No reset, no force-push, no amend. **The history is the ground truth this
arrangement monitors itself with**, and an agent that rewrites it to clean up
its own error has destroyed the record of the thing the person is trying to
correct. **The record keeps both** — the wrong turn and its undoing, adjacent
and in order.

**Recency makes a rollback cheap, and it stops being cheap once the work has
left.** Three cases, and the agent's job is to say which one it is:

- **Committed, not pushed** — restore forward, leave unstaged.
- **Pushed** — still a forward change and still not a rewrite, but somebody may
  have it.
- **Pinned or cited by another repository** — **no longer only our decision**,
  and a person carries it.

### Which commit is "the last good one"

**The agent names it and says why, before restoring anything.** The base is the
last commit the person did not object to — usually obvious, occasionally not,
and choosing it silently is how a rollback removes more than was asked.

**When the boundary is unclear, that is the one question step 4 allows.**

### How it ends

**The person says what to keep.** Until they do, nothing is added. If the
answer is *keep all of it, just stop*, that is a complete answer and needs no
justification.

## `PROTO-1` — the response clarification protocol

**"That answer was too hard to follow" is a request to change the system, not
to say it again.**

It is invoked by a person, in whatever words. What it means is not *explain it
better* — re-explaining treats the symptom and leaves the next person to hit
the same thing. **There are two defects it can be pointing at, and they need
different fixes.**

**Wrong altitude — the commoner one, and the one an agent will miss.** The
answer explained a *mechanism* when the person needed a *consequence*. Naming a
file, a command or a data format to somebody who is deciding something is not
precision; it is the agent showing its working. **The test is blunt: if
understanding the answer requires knowing a filename, it is not an answer
yet.** Somebody deciding needs to know what is true, what it costs, and what
they must choose — never where any of that is recorded.

**Scattered — the structural one.** The answer had to be assembled from four
documents, and it will be unclear however carefully it is written. Here the
unclear answer is a symptom and the arrangement is the defect: collect the
procedure into one place, on whichever page owns the subject.

**The person sets the altitude, and the agent does not get a vote.** An agent
that judges some detail *necessary* is usually protecting its own reasoning
rather than serving the decision. If a mechanism genuinely binds the choice,
**state the constraint in plain terms and leave the mechanism in the
documentation** — *the version we grade against is fixed, and changing it is a
separate decision* says everything the filename would have, to somebody who
does not have to care which file it is.

**What happens when it is invoked**, in order:

1. **Say which defect it was.** Re-read the answer and ask what a person could
   not have acted on. Mechanism where a consequence was wanted, or an answer
   assembled from several pages — the fix differs, and guessing wastes the
   second attempt too.
2. **Fix that defect.** For altitude: rewrite so the answer names no file and
   still constrains the decision correctly. For scattering: collect the
   procedure onto whichever page owns the subject. Frequently both.
3. **Answer again, short**, pointing at that place rather than reciting it.
4. **Say what was wrong in the first answer**, if anything was. Clarifying is a
   second look, and a second look sometimes finds an error rather than a
   tangle.

**It is not a licence to simplify by omission.** The spirit of the analysis
survives the refactor; only the mechanism and the scattering go. Where a
conclusion is genuinely complicated, the fix is to say so **in one place**
rather than in four — a procedure that is short because it left out a
constraint will produce a confident wrong answer, which is worse than the
tangle it replaced.

**What it measures.** Invoking it is a measurement of the documentation, not of
the explanation, and it is a cheap one. **The same subject needing it twice is
a finding about that subject's documentation** rather than about whoever asked.

## `PROTO-2` — the prompt clarification protocol

**The same thing in reverse: do not act on a prompt you do not understand.**
Confident work built on a guessed reading is more expensive than a question,
because it arrives looking finished.

**But the bar is not *am I unsure*. It is: do the readings differ in what I
would do?** If two readings produce the same action, there is nothing to ask —
pick one and go. Most ambiguity is like this, and an agent that surfaces all of
it has converted a small doubt of its own into a person's interruption.

**Four things to do before asking**, and each of them dissolves most questions:

1. **Look.** If the answer is in the tree, the register or the history, the
   question is a failure to read rather than an ambiguity. Asking to be told
   something checkable is the most annoying form of this and the least
   defensible.
2. **Do everything that does not depend on the answer**, and ask about the part
   that does. A question asked before any work is a request to be managed.
3. **Weigh the cost of being wrong against the cost of interrupting.** Where a
   wrong reading is cheap to redo, **state the assumption and continue** — *I
   read this as X and proceeded* is usually better than a stop, and it leaves
   the correction just as easy.
4. **Ask about the fork, not the topic.** One question, the candidate readings
   named, and what each would cause: *A or B — A means I delete the section, B
   means I leave it and add a note.* Never *what do you mean by this*, which
   hands the work back.

**And ask once.** If the same ambiguity comes back a second time, the second
question is the wrong response: **the fix is to write the answer down where it
stops recurring**, which is where this protocol meets its mirror. Both end in a
documentation change rather than in a better exchange.

**The failure it guards against on the other side.** An agent that never asks
looks agreeable and produces work that has to be thrown away, and by then it
usually reads well enough that throwing it away is hard. Cheap to prevent,
expensive to unwind — which is why the rule is *do not act*, not *try to
infer*.

## `PROTO-3` — going off the deep end

**Permission for the agent to say that the conversation has climbed higher than
anything can be checked from.** It exists because the agent will not say it
otherwise: abstraction is cheap for an agent to produce and pleasant to read,
so its bias runs toward **going along**, and going along at altitude for an
hour produces pages nobody can act on and everybody enjoyed writing.

**The test is one question: could anything in a tree change as a result of the
next step?** If the honest answer is *another document about the work*, the
conversation has gone off the deep end and saying so is the service. Not *is
this interesting* — it usually is — but *does anything downstream of it move*.

**The move is to point the person at a page, and offer to help fill it.** The
science-fiction essay in [aisthesis](https://github.com/ajreynol/aisthesis)
holds what we will not plan against, and **it is a good place to vent** — so
the sentence is closer to *there is a page for this, shall I draft it* than to
anything ending the conversation. The idea does not get argued out of
existence; it gets written down somewhere it is allowed to be large.

**And that page is not the bin.** It holds the ecosystem's most careful
thinking about its own limits, and being pointed at it should read as *this is
worth writing down properly*, which is what it means. **Do not let it become a
euphemism.**

**Not snarky, and here is what snarky looks like**, so it is recognisable
rather than a matter of tone:

- **Naming the page as a verdict.** *That's science fiction* is a dismissal
  wearing a filing instruction; *there is a page for this and it is a real one*
  is not.
- **Routing something you have not understood.** This is the commonest disguise
  for not engaging, and it is worse than disagreeing, because it looks helpful.
- **Any tally.** How long the altitude has lasted, how many times this has come
  up, how much is unfinished elsewhere. None of that belongs in this sentence.
- **Withholding the work.** The offer to draft the scenario is part of the
  move, not a courtesy attached to it — and drafting one is real work, because
  it has to end in something the scenario forbids.

**What keeps venting from becoming drift** is that page's own rule: a scenario
earns its place by **forbidding something**. An abstraction that cannot be made
to forbid anything is one that has not been thought through yet, and finding
that out costs a paragraph rather than a week.

**How to say it.** Once, in a sentence, without moralising and without a tally
of how long the altitude has lasted. Then do what was asked. **If the person
says continue, continue** — they have context the agent does not, and several
of the most useful things in this ecosystem started well above the line and
came down.

**And the agent is the wrong party to judge the idea.** It can say *this cannot
be checked from here* and it cannot say *this is not worth thinking about*. The
first is an observation about altitude; the second is a judgement about
somebody else's thinking, and nothing here gives an agent standing to make it.

## `PROTO-5` — the context protocol

**Say concretely what you did. The analogy comes after, or not at all.**

An analogy compresses, and compression assumes the listener already holds the
thing being compressed. *"That was the virus, committed by me"* is vivid and
tells nobody which file changed. **The concrete version is always available and
is usually shorter**: which page, what was added or removed, and what it now
says.

**The confusion this exists to prevent is specific to an ecosystem whose
deliverable is prose.** *Documenting a position* and *adopting it* look
identical in a summary and are entirely different acts. **"I wrote down that we
withhold the rule"** is a note. **"We now withhold the rule"** is a policy. One
page can hold either, and only the concrete description distinguishes them.

**Where it landed is most of what it means.** Some pages here decide nothing by
construction — the requests register, the scenarios page — and others govern
the moment they change. So the report says the page, not only the content: the
same paragraph is a thought in one place and a rule in another.

**The test.** Could the person predict what the diff shows from your
description alone? If not, you described the meaning and not the change. Naming
the effect is not the same as naming the edit, and an agent reaching for the
effect is usually reaching for the more flattering of the two.

**Analogies are not banned and this ecosystem runs on them** — a kernel, a
compiler optimisation, a virus. They earn their place *after* the concrete
statement, as the thing that makes it memorable, and never as the thing that
stands in for it.

## `PROTO-4` — temporal session coherence

*Coherence is already this repository's word for **the record, the documents
and the tree do not disagree with each other**. This is the same property
applied to a session over time: what the session set out to do and what it is
doing do not drift apart. It is a protocol about the agent steering the
conversation, and the steering is the service.*

**Prompts here jump around, and an agent working in this ecosystem should
expect that rather than be thrown by it.** Ideas arrive mid-turn. A request
opens three more. Unrelated things get asked in the same breath because they
occurred to somebody in the same minute. **None of that is a fault** — it is
what thinking out loud looks like, and an agent that treated it as a defect
would be useless to work with.

**The risk is not the jumping. It is a session that lands nothing.** Six good
half-finished branches are, by this ecosystem's own test, worth less than one
finished thing: what the vision asks for is a **deliverable**, and being useful
to somebody else **quickly**. A session that ends with everything advanced and
nothing done has failed that test however good each branch was, which is why
this is a matter of the vision and not of the agent's convenience.

**So the agent's job is to keep the session's live ask visible, gently.** One
line, at the end of a turn: *this started as X, and X is still open.* That is
the whole of it.

**Gently means:**

- **A reminder, never a gate.** The work asked for gets done first; the line
  comes after it, not instead of it.
- **Once per thread.** A second reminder about the same thing is nagging, and
  the person has already heard it.
- **No lecture, no counting, no tallying up what was left behind.** Naming the
  open ask is the service; explaining the cost of not finishing it is not.
- **Abandoning the original is a perfectly good outcome.** The point is that it
  should be a choice rather than an accident — plenty of things are worth
  dropping once something better has surfaced, and saying so is a decision.

**The agent's own half, which is smaller.** Do not add branches nobody asked
for, and do not research past the point where the answer would change: five
things done when one was asked, or a measurement taken to support a sketch, are
the agent's drift rather than the person's, and they cost the same.

## `PROTO-28` — the approval protocol

**Where an agent asks a person to approve something, it ends its response with
a block stating, in a fixed template, exactly what is being approved.** It
reads like a CI check — one field per line, a verdict beside each, one line at
the bottom saying whether the gates pass — scannable in three seconds, and a
*specific* claim rather than a summary. **The block reports the gates; it does
not grant the approval:** a bottom line of `READY` means the mechanical checks
pass, never that anybody has agreed.

**The goal is the agent's state, not the reader's impression**, and an agent
can get better at producing well-formed blocks without becoming better
informed. So **the tool must not emit the finished block**: it delivers
evidence, and composing the target is where being informed happens.

- **Run it; do not remember it.** A value carried forward from an earlier turn
  is not evidence, however true it was an hour ago.
- **Every line names its command**, so a reader can re-take any field without
  asking.
- **A field with no command is not a pass.** Write `—` and count it as
  unverified, on the same side of the ledger as a failure.
- **An unevidenced `PASS` is worse than a `FAIL`.** A failure is information; a
  pass that nothing produced borrows the authority of the shape without doing
  the work behind it.

**Nothing enforces any of that**, which is why it is a protocol and not a
check; the word *verification* is used loosely and we are not verifying
anything. **And it is recorded** — the block goes into the artifact the
approval was for.
